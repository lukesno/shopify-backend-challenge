# shopify-backend-challenge
Shopify's Backend Challenge for Summer 2022 Internships

Current Structure of Backend:

Two major components
-> APIs
-> Templates + Views that templates use

APIs focus on communicating with the database and returning JSON data whenever needed (GET requests)

Views for templates act as intermediates that check for validity of data being passed to APIs
(Maybe move error checking to APIs by utilizing serializers!)
